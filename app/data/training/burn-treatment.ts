      description: 'Burns are one of the most mistreated injuries. They are classified into three degrees:\n\n• 1st-degree burns affect only the surface of the skin, causing pain, but the skin remains intact without blisters or scarring.\n\n• 2nd-degree burns create blisters that may break open, leaving moist skin. Scarring is common.\n\n• 3rd-degree burns are deep injuries resulting in dry, leathery skin.\n\nBurns can result from sun exposure, radiation, fire, flames, and chemical exposure. The initial treatment focuses on stopping further heating of the skin.'
